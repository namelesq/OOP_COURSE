With millions of cats and dogs killed in shelters in the United States every year, adopting a pet instead of buying one saves at least one animal's life. Adoption saves not only the animal you adopt, but also the new animal the shelter can take in. Adopting from a shelter helps both ends of the problem: fewer animals will be bred, and more animals can go to a good home.
